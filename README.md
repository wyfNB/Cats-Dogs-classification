# Cats-Dogs-classification
Kaggle Competition: Dogs vs. Cats Redux: Kernels Edition
Datasets from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition
The model is based on VGG19.
A self-defined network is also included.
Need to split the training datasets into two parts: one for training,one for evaluation
To accelerate the model traning, a pretrained vgg19 model is also needed:https://download.pytorch.org/models/vgg19-dcbb9e9d.pth
More networks will be uploaded soon...
